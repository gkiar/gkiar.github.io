    <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on lowering the barrier to performing and evaluating high-quality
    science. While this may have many possible meanings depending on context or application,
    I believe it starts with generating reproducible and stable results. I have developed or
    contributed to a number of projects which have approached this from several different
    angles, including:</p>
    <h4>Tool &amp; Standards Development</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy016">Boutiques</a>, a domain-agnostic standard for tool descriptions (<a href="https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques">Code</a>)</li>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209">BIDS Apps</a>, a neuroimaging-specific standard for data analysis (<a href="https://github.com/BIDS-Apps">Repositories</a>)</li>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2019.00012">Clowdr</a>, a portable analysis tool for clouds and computing clusters (<a href="https://github.com/clowdr/clowdr">Code</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Uncertainty &amp; Reproducibility Analysis Techniques</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/802629">Fuzzy</a>, a computational environment for numerical analysis</li>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/802629">Discriminability</a>, a statistic for performing test-retest experiments</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Open Science</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ossig.netlify.app/">OHBM Open Science</a>, a community focused on running inclusive global events for collaboration and training</li>
      <li><a href="https://school.brainhackmtl.org/">Brainhack School</a>, a boot-camp style course teaching neuroinformatics to graduate students</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/gkiar/gitmarklet">Gitmarklet app</a>, a web-extension for recording publications and annotations using GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    In addition to contributing to these tools, standards, and techniques, I adopt many of them in my own
    research as well. A series of my publications is linked below, which shows how researchers can go from
    comparing methods for evaluating the stability of their analysis pipelines, up to ultimately improving
    the quality of their data-driven predictive models using these techniques.
		</p>
    <h4>Stability Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparing perturbation methods for neuroimaging pipelines (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1094342020926237">Link</a>)</li>
      <li>Exploring analytic impact of numerical perturbations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.341495">Link</a>)</li>
      <li>Dataset augmentation through numerical perturbation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.423084">Link</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    While there are many more things that could be said or explored, if you're interested in looking a
    little bit closer at what I do and how I do it, feel free to check out the links below. Everything I
    do is and will be open, and will likely be more up-to-date than this website if you go directly to
    the source.
