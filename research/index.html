    <h2>Research Highlights</h2>
    <p> As an advocate of open science, why not open degrees, too? This page is home to
    a variety of content I produced throughout my Ph.D., including official requirements, 
    grant applications (both funded and unfunded), and anything else I thought may be generically
    useful as a teaching aid.</p>
		<p>
    Note: the Ph.D. material was compliant with the rules and regulations of the programme
    in Biomedical and Biological Engineering at McGill University at the time of my enrollment, so
    if you happen to be a student looking at this, <em>always</em> defer to any examples provided by
    your institution.
