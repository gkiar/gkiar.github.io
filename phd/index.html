    <h1>Ph.D. Work</h1>
    <p> I'm all about open science, so why not open degrees, too? This page will be home to
    links of various documents and presentations I produce throughout the Ph.D. and grant applications
    processes. Note: the Ph.D. material is compliant with the rules and regulations of the programme
    in Biomedical and Biological Engineering at McGill University, so if you happen to be a fellow
    student looking at this, <em>always</em> defer to any examples provided by your institution.
    All of the resources in the lists below are covered under the CC-BY licence, meaning you can leverage
    and build upon the work and ideas therein, so long as you credit me with original creation.
