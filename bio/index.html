<h2>Bio Sketch</h2>
<p> Hey! That's my brain! Move around in it, I think it'll tell you all you need to know... </p>

<p>Things my brain will tell you:
<ul>
<li>I care about those rep-* words and making sure science is trustworthy</li>
<li>I enjoy computational statistics, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning</li>
<li>I work with brains, despite knowing very little about brains</li>
<li>I enjoy teaching</li>
<li>I share everything I do, including failures (see my <a href="/phd">open-Ph.D.</a>)</li>
<li>I am the proud teller of many terrible jokes</li>
<li>I have a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from McGill</li>
<li>I have a M.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins</li>
<li>I have a B.Eng in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering from Carleton</li>
</ul>
