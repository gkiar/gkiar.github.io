<h2>Bio Sketch</h2>
<p> I am an Electrical Engineer (B.Eng, Carleton University) and Biomedical Engineer (B.Eng,
Carleton University; M.S.E., Johns Hopkins University; Ph.D. in progress, McGill University)
working in neuroinformatics.</p>

<p>During my Ph.D. with Dr. Alan C. Evans and Dr. Tristan Glatard, I am developing tools and
methods to increase the accessibility of analyzing so-called "big data" in neuroscience, and
am working towards an approach for quantifying the performance of pipelines with respect to
reliability, repeatability, reproducibility, stability, robustness, generalizability, and 
whatever other buzz-words can be used to describe trustworthiness.</p>

<p> I love to teach, advocate and participate in open-science, and am doing an
<a href="/phd">open-Ph.D.</a> in which I am sharing my fellowship applications (both successful
and unsuccessful), degree requirement documents, presentations, proposals, etc., with the hope
that other students may find them useful resources.</p>

<p> My eventual goal is to be a tenure-track professor (yes, I know the odds...), ideally at a
Canadian University, as this is my home. </p>

<p> I also have two pet rabbits that are cute. </p>
