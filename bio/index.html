<div class="about">

<h2>Bio Sketch</h2>
<p> I am an Electrical Engineer (B.Eng, Carleton University) and Biomedical Engineer (B.Eng,
Carleton University; M.S.E., Johns Hopkins University; Ph.D. in progress, McGill University)
working in neuroinformatics. During my Ph.D. with Dr. Alan C. Evans and Dr. Tristan Glatard,
I am developing tools and methods to increase the accessibility of analyzing so-called "big data"
in neuroscience, and am working towards an approach for quantifying the performance of pipelines
with respect to reliability/repeatability, reproducibility, stability/robustness, and
generalizability. </p>


<p> I love to teach, and have taught for over 1,000 hours between my Undergraduate and Master's
degrees to both undergraduate and graduate students in subjects including introductory C++,
advanced electromagnetism and power engineering, biomedical engineering design, statistical
connectomics, the art of data science, and neuroinformatics experimental design and validation.
I have also taught "Brainhacking 101" at international conferences and publicly available online
courses, as well as "Exploratory Data Analysis" (videos available on YouTube). <p>


<p> I am very passionate about open-science, open-data, and just about anything else open-. All code
and data products I've produced since entering my Master's degree have been publicly released and
accessible. I am also doing an <a href="/phd">open-Ph.D.</a> in which I am sharing my fellowship
applications (both successful and unsuccessful), degree requirement documents, presentations,
proposals, etc., with the hope that other students may find them useful resources. </p>

<p> I am a member of the Open Science Special Interest Group within the Organization for Human Brain
Mapping, a Co-President of the Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives Trainee Committee at McGill, and
active member of several open-source coding communities. I regularly participate in and plan events
in the "BrainHack" series aimed at fostering learning and open-collaborations in neuroinformatics. </p>

<p> My eventual goal is to be a Tenure-Track professor (yes, I know the odds...), ideally at a Canadian
University, as this is my home. </p>

<p> I also have two pet rabbits that are cute. </p>
