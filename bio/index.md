## Bio Sketch

#### Timeline

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at Carleton University in 2014.
My undergraduate work consisted primarily of signal processing and circuit design, with an emphasis towards
applications in bioinstrumentation. I then completed my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) with Joshua Vogelstein in 2016. Throughout my Master's I developed open-source
software towards statistical connectomics research.

In the year after graduating from my Master's degree, I worked as a Field Engineer for the Kavli
Neuroscience Discovery Institute, still within Joshua Vogelstein's lab at JHU, focused on developing ''The
International Brain Station,'' an ecosystem for reliable, scalable, and accessible neuroscience data, tools,
visualizations, and analyses.

As of May 2017, I will be working towards my PhD at McGill University in the McGill Center for Integrative
Neuroscience (MCIN) in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) with Alan Evans, continuing to work on a
common ecosystem and platform for performing scalable neuroscience research.

#### Select Work

Some of my professional passions are accesibility, reliability, robustness, design, and scientific storytelling.
I try to apply all 5 of these ideas to tools I develop, as I believe that in order for something to be maximally
impactful one must be able to use it, evaluate it, trust it, enjoy using it, and understand it.

> ``Science is only as good as the story telling it...''

I have significant experience in neuroimaging analysis and software development. Throughout my Master's
degree I developed a reliable [one-click pipeline](https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg) for structural connectome
estimation from diffusion and structural MR images. In addition to the pipeline being shared via Github and
pip, I have integrated it with various initiatives to standardize tools, such as creating a
[Boutiques](http://boutiques.github.io) descriptor, and participating in a recent initiative on developing
[BIDS-Apps](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209).

I have used my pipeline (ndmg) to generate over 50,000 connectomes across a range of scales and share them
[publicly for the community](http://m2g.io) to analyze. I have spent significant time understanding and
deploying pipelines to the cloud, and have developed a framework for performing highly reproducible
[science in the cloud](http://scienceinthe.cloud).

In addition to developing tools, I have written demos and blog posts for a variety of purposes, ranging from
using spatial databases with [electron microscopy data](http://neurostorm.io) to an
[example describing how to write a Boutiques descriptor](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques/tree/master/examples).


#### Teaching

Throughout my degrees at Carleton and JHU I taught over 1,000 hours at a variety of levels, ranging from freshmen
to graduate students, in a variety of subjects, including basic C++, advanced electomagnetism and power engineering,
data science, and biosignal processing and modeling.

Additionally, a colleague and I designed and taught our own 3-week intensive introductory course on connectomics for 3
years, and received course evaluations atop the school of Engineering at JHU. I have also supervised undergraduate
research groups on a diverse range of subject areas, including EEG signal denoising, fMRI connectome estimation,
CLARITY preprocessing and alignment, and synapse detection in light microscopy data.


#### Personal

I'm a Canadian who describes the most difficult part of living in Baltimore for 3 years as the lack of hockey coverage
on local sports stations. That seems sufficient for now.


#### Moving Forward

As my the blueprint of my scientific career continues to unfold, I hope to leave my mark on two areas of special
importance to me: mental health and education.

I believe that these two things are the greatest and most fundamental challenges in humanity; broadly speaking, without
education people aren't able to be free, and without mental health people can't happily and safely be themselves.

My goal is for the tools I build, experiments I conduct, and theories or frameworks I develop to not only be leveraged
directly by those who may benefit from them, but that they inspire others to challenge and improve them.

In short, my dream is to help empower and enable everyone else to accomplish theirs.
