## Bio Sketch

I completed my undergraduate degree in Biomedical and Electrical Engineering at Carleton University in 2014.
My undergraduate work consisted primarily of signal processing and circuit design, with an emphasis towards applications in bioinstrumentation.
I then completed my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with Joshua Vogelstein in 2016.
Throughout my Master's I developed open-source software towards statistical connectomics research.
In the year since graduating from my Master's degree, I have been working as a Field Engineer for the Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute, still within Joshua's lab at Johns Hopkins, focused on building ''The International Brain Station,'' an ecosystem for reliable, scalable, and accessible neuroscience data, tools, visualizations, and analyses.
As of May 2017, I will be working towards my PhD at McGill University in the MNI with Alan Evans, continuing to work on a common ecosystem and platform for performing scalable neuroscience research.

I have significant experience in neuroimaging analysis and software development.
Throughout my Master's degree I developed a reliable [one-click pipeline](https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg) for structural connectome estimation from diffusion and structural MR images.
In addition to the pipeline being shared via Github and PyPi, I have integrated it with various initiatives to standardize tools, such as creating a [Boutiques](http://boutiques.github.io) descriptor, and participating in a recent initiative on developing [BIDS-compliant apps](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005209).
I have used my pipeline (ndmg) to generate over 50,000 connectomes across a range of scales and share them [publicly for the community](http://m2g.io).
I have spent significant time understanding and deploying pipelines to the cloud, and have developed a framework for performing highly reproducible [science in the cloud](http://scienceinthe.cloud).
In addition to developing functionality, I have written demos and blog posts for a variety of purposes, ranging from using spatial databases with [electron microscopy data](http://neurostorm.io) to an [example for writing a Boutiques descriptor](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques/tree/master/examples).

Throughout my degrees at Carleton and Johns Hopkins I have taught over 1,000 hours at a variety of levels, ranging from freshmen to graduate students, in a variety of subjects, including basic C++, advanced electomagnetism and power engineering, data science, and biosignal processing and modeling.
Additionally, with a colleague I designed and taught my own 3-week intensive introductory course on connectomics for the past 3 years, and received course evaluations atop the school of Engineering at JHU.
I have also supervised undergraduate research groups on a diverse range of subject areas, including EEG signal denoising, fMRI connectome estimation, CLARITY preprocessing and alignment, and synapse detection in light microscopy data.
