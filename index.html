  <p>I am a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://childmind.org/">Child Mind Institute</a>, where I focus on evaluating and
improving the trustworthiness of tools and techniques used to study the brain.</p>
	<p>I apply computational statistics, uncertainty quantification, pipeline development, and machine learning towards understanding and
leveraging the numerical uncertainty in neuroimaging software.</p>
  <p>The goal of my work is to increase the transparency of published results as well as the generalizability and robustness of
  biomarkers we derive from them.</p>
